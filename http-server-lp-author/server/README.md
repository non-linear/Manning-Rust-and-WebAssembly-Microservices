# HTTP server

Please [install the prerequisites](../README.md) first!

## Quick start with Docker

```
$ docker run -dp 8080:8080 --rm --runtime=io.containerd.wasmedge.v1 --platform=wasi/wasm secondstate/rust-example-server:latest
... ...

$ curl http://localhost:8080/
Try POSTing data to /echo such as: `curl localhost:8080/echo -XPOST -d 'hello world'`

$ curl http://localhost:8080/echo -X POST -d "Hello WasmEdge"
Hello WasmEdge
```

## Code

The [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) source code shows how to start an async server using the `hyper` crate.

* The `main()` function is now an `async` function and annotated with the `tokio` macro. That means the tokio controller can spawn multiple instances of the `main()` app.
* Each instance of the `main()` app listens at port 8080 without blocking the port for everyone else. It receives a data `stream` for each incoming HTTP connection it captures.
  * The `accept()` function runs in a loop. It accepts an incoming connection, processes its data, and then start over.
  * Since the data connection could be slow, the `accept()` function could take a long time to return. But it is async, meaning that multiple instances of `accept()` could run concurrently to receive data from multiple connections on the same port.
  * The `await` blocks each instance of `accept()` so that the statements after `accept()` would not run until `accept()` receives all the data in a connection and returns.
* The `tokio::task::spawn` API designate the `handle_request()` function to be called whenever the data `stream` is available.
* The data in the `stream`, which is a HTTP request is passed to `handle_request()`, and the function returns an HTTP response struct.
* Inside `handle_request()`, it matches both the HTTP request method and path.
  * If the HTTP request is a GET at `/`, it returns a response with a help message.
  * If the HTTP request is a POST at `/echo`, it extracts the HTTP body and echoes it back as the HTTP response.
  * If no match is found, it returns an HTTP 404 error code.

## Step by step guide

Compile the Rust source code project to a Wasm bytecode file.

```
$ cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

Run the Wasm bytecode file in WasmEdge CLI.

```
$ wasmedge target/wasm32-wasi/release/server.wasm
Listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

From another terminal window, do the following.

```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/
Try POSTing data to /echo such as: `curl localhost:8080/echo -XPOST -d 'hello world'`

$ curl http://localhost:8080/echo -X POST -d "Hello WasmEdge"
Hello WasmEdge
```

## Build and publish on Docker

The `Dockerfile` follows the above steps to build and package a lightweight OCI-compliant container image for the Wasm app.
Now, we need to publish the container image to Docker Hub. The process is slightly different depending on how you plan to use the image.

### For Docker Desktop and containerd

For containerd based systems, such as the Docker Desktop and many flavors of Kubernetes,
you just need to specify that the WasmEdge application image is for the `wasi/wasm` platform.

```
$ docker buildx build --provenance=false --platform wasi/wasm -t secondstate/rust-example-server .
... ...
$ docker push secondstate/rust-example-server
```
